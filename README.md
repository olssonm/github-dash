# Github Dash

Github [recently updated the dashboard](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-05-17-user-landingpage-changes/) – most of the changes are very much welcome. But for a user as me – who works mostly in very small teams (or even by myself) on multiple projects at once the ordering of the repos doesn't make much sense and messes with my usual workflow.

<del>This update also removed the highlights of the private repos for some reason</del> (Github issued a fix for this on May 30th).

**This simple Chrome-extension injects another module with "Recently updated" repositories, and also once again highlights the repos that are private.**

Quickly written using jQuery in a very inefficient manner – but it does it's job. Might put some more time into it later if needed.

**With the extension installed:**

### Thanks

As this is my first Chrome extension, I checked out [@urre](https://github.com/urre)'s great [avanza-night-mode](https://github.com/urre/avanza-night-mode)-extension to get a grasp on how it's done.
