# Github Dash

**Tweak the Github-dashboard to make it (more) usable again.**

Github [recently updated the dashboard](https://blog.github.com/changelog/2018-05-17-user-landingpage-changes/), most of the changes are very much welcome. But for a user as me – who works mostly in very small teams (or even by myself) on multiple projects at once the ordering of the repos doesn't make any sense and messes with my usual workflow (before this update the repositories was ordered by when they was last updated which made it quick and easy to find repos for PRs etc.)  

This simple Chrome-extension injects another module with "Recently updated" repositories, and also once again highlights the repos that are private.

Quickly written using jQuery in a very inefficient manner – but it does it's job. Might put some more time into it later if needed.

### Thanks

As this is my first Chrome extension, I checked out [@urre](https://github.com/urre)s great [avanza-night-mode](https://github.com/urre/avanza-night-mode)-extension to get a grasp on how it's done.
